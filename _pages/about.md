I am a PhD candidate in the Biophysics program at Harvard University, where I am advised by Cengiz Pehlevan.  As an undergraduate I attended Rice University, where I studied physics, chemical physics, and mathematics and worked with Jose Onuchic on genome organization and mechanics.

My current research focuses on understanding how the physical properties of biological neural networks affect their ability to perform computations.
